# Articles for User Information Statistics

This plugin adds a counter of articles by a user to their profile in WoltLab Suite.

## Features
    - comes with an option to be (de)activated - see ACP -> Configuration -> Users -> User Information Statistics

## Requirements
    - at least WoltLab Suite Core 5.5.11
    - the article module (obviously)

## Future
    - should work with WoltLab Suite 6.0 - though untested and not officially supported for obvious reasons (it's in development, still)
